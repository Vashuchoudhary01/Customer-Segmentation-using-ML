# 📊 Customer Segmentation Project (EDA Phase)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer demographics, behavior, and purchasing patterns. The objective of this phase is to extract meaningful insights that will support customer clustering and business decision-making in the next stage.

Currently, the project includes **only the EDA part**. Modeling and segmentation will be added in the upcoming phase.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset  
- Analyze customer demographics and behavioral features  
- Identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data  
- Prepare the dataset for future clustering algorithms  

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related information such as:
- Demographic details (education, age, marital status)
- Income and financial attributes
- Spending behavior across product categories
- Marketing campaign response and engagement data  

*(Dataset is used for learning and project demonstration purposes.)*

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Checked dataset shape and data types  
- Identified numerical and categorical variables  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values  
- Treated inconsistent or invalid data  
- Removed unnecessary columns (if applicable)  

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of numerical features  
- Frequency analysis of categorical variables  
- Education level and demographic breakdown  

### 4️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Relationship between income and spending  
- Customer behavior across education levels  
- Comparative analysis of purchasing patterns  

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization
- Bar charts and pie charts for categorical variables  
- Histograms and boxplots for numerical features  
- Simple and clear visualizations for easy interpretation

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Customer education level shows variation in purchasing behavior  
- Income has a strong influence on spending patterns  
- Certain customer groups are more responsive to campaigns  
- The data shows clear potential for meaningful segmentation
